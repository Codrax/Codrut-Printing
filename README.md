# Codrut-Printing
 A Semi-Advanced printing dialog for pictures, similar to the Windows Print Pictures Dialog, but with more advanced features, custom images and Double Sided Printing

### Main Features

- Image Tiling
- Custom Image Sizes
- Advanced Margins
- Image Fill Modes
- Double Sided Printing
- Printer Information
- Multiple File Printing
- Rearrange file print order

### The installer is available below, although this application can work in any directory and does not require any specific DLLS so the app will work without the installer as well. 


### Currently, all bugs have been fleshed out

## Compiling the program
### To compile the program you will need at least Delphi 10.4 Comunity Edition. Also you will require a few external libraries, also made by me.
#### The Required Libraries are

- Codrut Visual Library - https://github.com/Codrax/CodrutsVisualLibrary/
- Codrut Fluent Design System - https://github.com/Codrax/CodrutFluentDesignSystem

The reason I have two Visual Libraries is because most of the components from CodrutsVisualLibrary will be slowly migrated to CodrutFluentDesignSystem, which is intended to be a more open and less dependent library focued only on UI.
